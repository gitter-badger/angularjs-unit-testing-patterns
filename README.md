# Angular Unit Testing Patterns

There is a lot of guides out there explaining how to use [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular) and [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) together. However, there isn't really a lot of guides explaining how you should test your controllers services, directives, and anything in between.

Hopefully, this guide sheds some light on what you actually need to test and explain why you should be testing it that way. Most of the patterns that you see here are patterns that I myself use on my projects.
